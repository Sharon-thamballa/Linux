Ansible is a Configuration Management
Configuration Management
-----------------------------------
This is process of configuring remote servers from one point of control.
Advantages
----------------------
1) Provisioning of servers
	The applications that should be installed on server can be done very quickly from a single centralized location. 
	so that client can save time and resources.

2) Idempotent 
	Configuration management tools are used to bring the server to a particular state, 
	called as desired state. If a server already in the desired state
Note: Cofiguration management tools cannot be used for installing OS from the scratch.
They can be used only for managing the applications on top of the OS.
COnfigutaion management tools -  Ansible, chef, puppet, salt  etc
Ansible  -- It is a open source configuration management tool, created using Python.

Main machine in which anisble is installed, is called as controller.
Remote severs that Ansible configures, are called as managed nodes.

Ansible uses agent less policy for configures remote servers ie Ansible is installed only on 1 machine, 
and we do not require any client side software to be installed on the remote serers.

Ansible performs configuration management through password less ssh  --(from the controller to the remote servers.)

Establish password less ssh connection between controller and managed nodes.you hav to mention to controller to configure these all particular nodes 
so for that Write the ip address of nodes in the inventory file which needs to be configured.
The file in which we mention the nodes Ip addresses called as inventory file.
